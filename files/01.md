*Introduction: What is the future? How can we think *about the future?*

`Chaque epoque reve la suivante (Each epoch dreams the one to follow)`    
<sup>[Benjamin, Walter. “Paris: Capital of the Nineteenth Century.” Perspecta 12 (1969): 165–72. https://doi.org/10.2307/1566965.](https://doi.org/10.2307/1566965)</sup>

`The future is a kind of history that hasn’t happened yet.`  
`Twenty years {from 2018 to 2038} is a good long time. I’m thinking we’re probably in for some big, black-swan discontinuities that make most design ideas of the present day seem pretty silly. It’s like guys in 1938 trying to outguess 1958, in the style of Norman Bel Geddes.`

`‘Future cannot be experienced directly, but only though images, thoughts, feelings and the multiple ways these are subsequently expressed.`
