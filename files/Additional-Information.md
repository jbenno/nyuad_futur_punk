### Course Rationale

Over the last decade, science fiction as become not only a widely accepted literature genre. Strategic foresight, speculative design, and future studies with direct references to SciFi have become standard features in major business events and corporate presentations. While the former pulp genre has turned into a commodity, a new generation of artists, writers, and thinkers re-appropriate and refocus futurism into emerging subcultures of non-western identity-focused speculative fiction and art.

Understanding the tools of foresight, planning and controlling can be a key skill in a fast-changing humanity that has become aware of the consequences of global media exposure and the global threats. Futurism provides even more of a tool set to dream up, conceptualize, and prototype outside the strict factual norms. Thus, the futurist framework opens a bag of methods that help to facilitate envisioning things ahead of their time. The Emirates, with the strong dedication to a long-term future strategy, are the most fascinating place to study the applications of futurist thinking.

The course is laid-out to work with futurism as a creative tool. The field of futurism will be introduced and worked through along the lines of design, strategy, science and science fiction. While also introducing the more traditional methods of strategic planning and foresight, the main focus will be put on the emerging cultures of post-colonial futurism, in particular in the Gulf region. At the end, the students will have the skills to see the future like a futurist, and how to express what they see in a creative way.

### Learning Outcomes

1.	Get a solid overview on the field of futurism by reading and watching two or more key texts/talks/videos per week, summarizing and presenting your thoughts and discuss in class.
2.	Build skills in understanding the futurist framework from business and policy-making perspective by applying it to various “real world” tasks: In weekly assignments as well as the two projects, you will develop scenarios, bring your application into a format to share with and to get feedback from the class.
3.	Practice creative making within the futurist frameworks, focused on interactive media: Although critical reading/watching/writing/discussion will be part of weekly assignments, creativity and exploration of interactive media will be strongly emphasized.
4.	Reflecting on the Gulf region: Application of the course’s topics to aspects of the Emirates and the region.

## Teaching and Learning Methodologies

⁃ Critical reading and watching: understand what’s the intention, what’s the power structure, and unveil the hidden ideologies.
⁃ Creativity and maker mindset in a studio-class setup: take apart and repurpose, draft, design, and build.
⁃ Presentation and discussion: Classes include prepared short presentations by students and discussions on the readings and other assigned material.
⁃ Inclusion and diversity: We will respect each other in our specific culture and personal values, we will focus on listening to everybody’s voice, in class and by focussing on material outside the mainstream.
 
## Assignments

- Reading and watching the provided material is required each week in advance.
- Assigned readings and videos will be discussed in class. Preparedness (i.e. having read/watched the assigned material), active participation, and therefore attendance to the classes will be graded.
- All assignments are to be submitted via NYU Classes. Submitting just a link is absolutely sufficient unless stated otherwise.

## Grades and Rubrics

10% Participation: Active contribution to the discussions, showing initiative, taking on tasks outside the assignments.
30% Assignments: Preparedness (having actually read/watched the material), timely submission of assignments, quality of work (see rubrics), presenting in class.
30% - Midterm project
30% - Final project

### Rubrics

20% Comprehension (understanding of the material, structure, argumentation)
30% Criticism (assessing the form, intention, preliminary conditions of the assigned material; questioning the arguments), resp. technical complexity for programming assignments
50% Creativity (Showing original thoughts and ideas; compelling form of presentation; creative use of various techniques with focus on interactive media; aesthetics of the experience)

### Assignments will be graded according to the following scale of 100%

- Poor	Evinced poor absorption of material, or made no effort (0-70%)
- Adequate	Accomplished enough to prove the student encountered the material (71-80%)
- Good	Demonstrated strong effort incorporating and articulating concepts in a creative way (81-90%)
- Excellent	Exceptional creativity, understanding and synthesis of the material (91-100%)

## Attendance and Participation

- Attendance is mandatory. Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will negatively impact your grade for the class. Being late for more than 15 minutes with no excuse will count as an unexcused absence. Two unexcused absences will result in a decrease in your overall final grade (i.e. B+ to B). Three will result in an entire letter grade drop (i.e. from A to B). Four will result in two letter grade drops (i.e. from A to C). More than four unexcused absences will result in an F.
- Engaging in the class discussion, offering feedback to peers, and being mentally present is a major part of the grade.
- Presenting work and writing in class is required, giving talks on topics is expected. 

### Social Media, Messaging, Notifications
- Absolutely no use of social media or messaging services in class - neither on phone nor on laptop except when it is the explicit topic.
- Notifications must be set to silence.
