# Future Punk

The future: let’s patch it together from scraps. Future studies and strategic foresight are 
methods of guiding businesses and politics. Punk means to take the master’s tools apart, 
repurpose them to serve our own goals. 

The compound of the words future and punk, just like in cyberpunk or steampunk, indicates 
that in the case of futurepunk, future itself would be setting the stage for the narrative, provide 
the condition against which the human beings in the world of the story have to struggle.
Science fiction readership is skyrocketing. Strategic foresight and speculative design have 
become standard features in business events. While the former pulp genre has turned into a 
commodity, a new generation of creatives re-appropriates futurism into emerging subcultures 
of non-western identity-focused speculative fiction and art.

Futurism can be a key skill for a fast-changing humanity that has become aware of global 
media exposure and global threats: To dream up, conceptualize, and prototype outside the 
strict factual norms. The Emirates, with the strong dedication to a long-term future strategy, 
are the most fascinating place to study the applications of futurist thinking.

The class introduces speculative fiction and the more scientific forms of speculation. Students 
envision, draft and draw their own images and imaginations of alternative worlds, discuss, 
critique and apply the futurist methods in the good old punk tradition, taking futurism and use 
it for their own creations.

#### Assignments
Draft the proposal of your final project.

### Week 12: Punk
*Patching it together*

The final project: Do punk stuff. Collage together what we have done so far. Now we have it all together. Let’s use the scraps we salvaged from our deconstruction of futurism. 

This week kicks off the final projects. The final project should introduce “the general public” (e.g. the audience of a media channel or visitors to a gallery show) to the universe of the course’s topic. It should be aesthetically as well as visually compelling incorporating critical thoughts and speculative creativity. In particular, the project should make use of the multicultural and polyglot environment on campus and in the Emirates, ideally shining light on a real task that might lie ahead of the Gulf region or a place with specific meaning and relation to the maker(s) of the project.

The project proposals will be presented and discussed in class.
