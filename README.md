# Future Punk

The future: let’s patch it together from scraps. Future studies and strategic foresight are 
methods of guiding businesses and politics. Punk means to take the master’s tools apart, 
repurpose them to serve our own goals. 

The compound of the words future and punk, just like in cyberpunk or steampunk, indicates 
that in the case of futurepunk, future itself would be setting the stage for the narrative, provide 
the condition against which the human beings in the world of the story have to struggle.
Science fiction readership is skyrocketing. Strategic foresight and speculative design have 
become standard features in business events. While the former pulp genre has turned into a 
commodity, a new generation of creatives re-appropriates futurism into emerging subcultures 
of non-western identity-focused speculative fiction and art.

Futurism can be a key skill for a fast-changing humanity that has become aware of global 
media exposure and global threats: To dream up, conceptualize, and prototype outside the 
strict factual norms. The Emirates, with the strong dedication to a long-term future strategy, 
are the most fascinating place to study the applications of futurist thinking.

The class introduces speculative fiction and the more scientific forms of speculation. Students 
envision, draft and draw their own images and imaginations of alternative worlds, discuss, 
critique and apply the futurist methods in the good old punk tradition, taking futurism and use 
it for their own creations.
