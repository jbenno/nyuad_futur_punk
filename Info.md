### Course Rationale

Over the last decade, science fiction as become not only a widely accepted literature genre. Strategic foresight, speculative design, and future studies with direct references to SciFi have become standard features in major business events and corporate presentations. While the former pulp genre has turned into a commodity, a new generation of artists, writers, and thinkers re-appropriate and refocus futurism into emerging subcultures of non-western identity-focused speculative fiction and art.

Understanding the tools of foresight, planning and controlling can be a key skill in a fast-changing humanity that has become aware of the consequences of global media exposure and the global threats. Futurism provides even more of a tool set to dream up, conceptualize, and prototype outside the strict factual norms. Thus, the futurist framework opens a bag of methods that help to facilitate envisioning things ahead of their time. The Emirates, with the strong dedication to a long-term future strategy, are the most fascinating place to study the applications of futurist thinking.

The course is laid-out to work with futurism as a creative tool. The field of futurism will be introduced and worked through along the lines of design, strategy, science and science fiction. While also introducing the more traditional methods of strategic planning and foresight, the main focus will be put on the emerging cultures of post-colonial futurism, in particular in the Gulf region. At the end, the students will have the skills to see the future like a futurist, and how to express what they see in a creative way.

### Learning Outcomes

1.	Get a solid overview on the field of futurism by reading and watching two or more key texts/talks/videos per week, summarizing and presenting your thoughts and discuss in class.
2.	Build skills in understanding the futurist framework from business and policy-making perspective by applying it to various “real world” tasks: In weekly assignments as well as the two projects, you will develop scenarios, bring your application into a format to share with and to get feedback from the class.
3.	Practice creative making within the futurist frameworks, focused on interactive media: Although critical reading/watching/writing/discussion will be part of weekly assignments, creativity and exploration of interactive media will be strongly emphasized.
4.	Reflecting on the Gulf region: Application of the course’s topics to aspects of the Emirates and the region.

### Teaching and Learning Methodologies

⁃	Critical reading and watching: understand what’s the intention, what’s the power structure, and unveil the hidden ideologies.
⁃	Creativity and maker mindset in a studio-class setup: take apart and repurpose, draft, design, and build.
⁃	Presentation and discussion: Classes include prepared short presentations by students and discussions on the readings and other assigned material.
⁃	Inclusion and diversity: We will respect each other in our specific culture and personal values, we will focus on listening to everybody’s voice, in class and by focussing on material outside the mainstream.

Attendance
----------
* Attendance is mandatory. Every class builds off the previous one so it is vital to be present for every lesson. Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will negatively impact your final grade for the class. If you are going to be late or absent, please email me **in advance**. If you have an emergency, please let me know as soon as you can.  
* If you are more than 15 minutes late to class with no excuse, it will count as an unexcused absence.
* Two unexcused absences will result in a decrease in your overall final grade (i.e. B+ to B). Three will result in an entire letter grade drop (i.e. from A to B). Four will result in two letter grade drops (i.e. from A to C). More than four unexcused absences will result in an F.
* Show up on time, we have a lot of material to cover and we'll need all of the class time. 

Participation
-------------
* Engaging in the class discussion, offering feedback to peers, and "being present" is a major part of your grade. Participating in class is helpful for me to get to know you as an individual and keep track of your progress, but most importantly, it provides you and your classmates the opportunity to share failures, successes, and insights on the work you are doing.
* You are expected to show work in class. This includes a working web site, a kind-of working web site, a non-working web site, a failed web site, a web site that works but not the way you expected it to work, and so on. Basically, don’t be afraid to volunteer to show what you did do or failed to do. Explaining your work to other people is a great way to better understand the material and answer questions for yourself. Plus, showing work that did not function as expected is not a sign of failure, it is an opportunity to learn.
* Ask questions. If you do not ask questions, I can only assume you understand the material completely.
* Respect the "Laptops" and "Mobiel Phones" policy described below. 

Laptops
-------
The quality of the class depends in large part on your attention and active participation, so please respect your fellow classmates and close your lid.

Mobile Phones
-------------
Please put them on vibrate or turn them off before you come to class. If you have an emergency that requires you to answer your phone during class, please let me know me ahead of time or quietly step out of class to take the call. Otherwise, please refrain from using your mobile phone during class for emailing, messaging, or any other non-class work. 

My availability
-----------
If you have any questions, would like extra help, or need further instruction, please reach out to me. You can communicate with me via e-mail, sign up for ofice hours, speak with me before class, after class or during break, but please let me know if you have any concerns pertaining to the course.

Accommodation
-------------
Diversity and inclusion are important tenets of NYUAD and my own teaching philosophy. Please let me know if you have a disability I should be aware of or require special assistance. I am happy to make accommodations.
